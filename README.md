# EventScripts-Emulator
A Source.Python plugin that is able to run EventScripts addons.

This is just a fun project and I have actually sworn to not create something like this. However, I got bored the other day and was curious how difficult it will be to create it. The first test addons are already working!

# Development status
1. Most of EventScripts' es_C module functions have been roughly implemented.
2. At the moment I'm only focused on getting the Python side fully working. Later I hope to get the experimental shell engine working.

# Note
I took the original EventScripts libraries from http://forums.eventscripts.com/index.php and adapted them to work with Python 3. I have also removed the test addons to keep it simple.
